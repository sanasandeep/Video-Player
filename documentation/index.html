		<h3 id="important"><strong>A) Important notes make sure you read this!</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Please note that the Video Player installation and configuration is not complicated but because it has a lot of customizable settings it might seem complicated, please go through the entire documentation before trying to install it into your own page. Basically what it must be done is to copy some html code from the examples we provided and paste it into your own html page and of course add your own video file.</p>
		<p>Video Player only requires the mp4 video format and it  will work in all browsers on a desktop machine or on a mobile device, this is extremely important because there is no need to create multiple video formats for browsers that dose not support mp4, also please note that the mp4 video format is recommended and used by all major browsers distributors like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozzila etc.!</p>
		<p>The server is character case sensitive so make sure that the Video Player settings are identical to those from the provided examples.</p>
		<p style="color:#FF0000;">When using mp4 video files located on your server with relative paths you must add all folders that contains mp4's videos in the content folder, this is extremely important in order for all features to work correctly.</p>
		<p>It is important to understand that the more video instances are used the browser will be more stressed and problems may occur specially on mobile. If you think at all popular video websites like youtube or video they are only using a single video instance and this is done because of performance issues... Try to keep the Video Player instances to a maximum of six instances if possible even less, this will help the browser to perform great. This recommendation applies to all video players available on the web including youtube or vimeo!</p>
		<p>When testing local on IE7/IE8 or on an older browser that dose not support HTML5 video it will not work because the flash (.swf) file is trying to communicate with the browser and this is not allowed, of course it will work fine when tested online.</p>
		<p>Some of the  features will not work local like the share button or playing youtube videos on some browsers like IE and Opera, or like playng vimeo videos, this is normal behavior because most browser does not allow this, once uploaded on the server it will function properly.</p>
		<p>If you don't need to use youtube set <span class="boldLi">useYoutube:"no"</span> the same applies if you don't want to use Vimeo set <span class="boldLi">useVimeo:"no"</span>, this is important because it will not createa the Vimeo or Youtube instances this will improve overall performance.</p>
		<p>When something is wrong with a Video Player actions a info box with the problem description will appear over the Video Player, please note that this box is there to help you understand the problem, for example if a mp4 video file is not found the box will appear and inform you about the problem. The box can be closed when clicked or touched.</p>
		<p>The Video Player skin is constructed from .png images, only  a few settings for changing colors are possible like changing the time color. If you want a different skin the .png files must be modified. The skin is really flexible this is allowing to skin the Video Player as you like. We have a great designer in our team so if you need a custom skin please contact us!</p>
		<p>To use EVP as a video a video background for your website set displayType:"backgroundVideo" .</p>
		<h3 id="instalation"><strong>B) Install Video Player into your html page.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>EVP has multiple display types (fluid width, responsive, fixed, fullscreen, after prt), each display type is explained in detail below.</p>

		<h4><strong>Responsive installation</strong></h3>

		<p>In the download files there is a start folder and in this folder there are html files starting with the label "responsive", each of this examples have exactly the same structure with different constructor settings. You can use one of them to copy and paste the required html code based on skin that you need, I will use the <span class="boldLi">responsive-skin-minimal-dark.html</span> as an example for this tutorial.</p>
		<p>The skin is created using javascript and .png images, if you want a custom skin please contact us. If you want to create a skin of your own modify the ones we already provided.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Copy and paste the content folder and the java folder into the same folder with your .html file, inside the content folder there are other folders which are self explanatory. Keep only the skin folders that you need to save space on the server.</li>
			<li>Open responsive-skin-minimal-dark.html with a text editor.</li>
			<li>The javascript file and css file must be imported, in the head section of your html file add the code from the below image.</li>
			<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true, class-name: 'negativeLeftMarginsHTML'">
				<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="content/global.css">
				<script type="text/javascript" src="java/FWDEVPlayer.js"></script>
			</pre>
			<li>You need a div into which the Video Player will be added as a child, so create a div and set an id for it, the id is important because it is passed in the Video Player constructor, make sure it is unique. The Video Player is responsive as follows, the width will adapt based on the <span class="boldLi">maxWidth</span> property specified in the constructor, the height is set based on the skin height, if the page is resized and the prt div width is smaller then the <span class="boldLi">maxWidth</span> property the Video Player will adapt its size accordingly.</li>
			<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true, class-name: 'negativeLeftMarginsHTML'">
				<div id="myDiv" style="margin:auto;"></div></script></pre>
			<li>Next step is to initialize the Video Player with javascript, in the head section of your html page add the code from the below image. Please note that all parameters are described in the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section.</li>
			<pre class="brush: js; class-name: 'negativeLeftMargins'">

		<p>This is how the player is installed in a HTML page, please read the  <a href="#config">Constructor parameters</a> section to understand the Video Player properties</p>

		<h4><strong>Lightbox installation.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
		<p>To install the EVP player in lightbox the exact same steps as in the <a href="#instalation">Responsive installation</a> must be followed, the only difference is that the <span class="boldLi">displyType</span> property must be set to <span class="boldLi">lightbox</span> as follows : <span class="boldLi">displyType:"lightbox"</span>. Inside the start folder there is a HTML file as reference called LIGHTBOX-example.html.</p>

		<h4><strong>Sticky installation.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
		<p>To install the EVP player in a sticky display type the exact same steps as in the <a href="#instalation">Responsive installation</a> must be followed, the only difference is that the <span class="boldLi">displyType</span> property must be set to <span class="boldLi">sticky</span> as follows : <span class="boldLi">displyType:"sticky"</span>.

		<p>Adding google adsense popup window or windows can be done with ease but it is a a little different then a pop-up image, some code has to be added inside the video player constructor, the example below will show better what I mean by that. Below you can see the code that has to be added into the constructor, the parameters  are self explanatory, you can add one or as many as you like. Please note that your adsense account has to be approved and active with the domain name where you will install the player also be very very careful with the google_ad_client and google_ad_slot, they have to be identical with the values from the add when you add them to the popup ad. If the account is not active or the google_ad_client or google_ad_slot are not correct the add will not appear and there will be no error displayed basically the google adsense server dosen't throw any error it will just fail silently.</p>

		<p>To set the video password there is a tool I have created that will encrypt the password <a href="http://www.gmail.com/ps/" target="_blank">at this link</a>, enter your desired password in the input field then click on the <span class="boldLi">Encrypt passowrd</span> button, once this is done copy the encrypted password and paste it as a value of the <span class="boldLi">privateVideoPassword</span> parameter from the constructor. Doing this steps will configure EVP to request a password before the video can play. The default password is Melinda and there is example provided in the start folder called PRIVATE-VIDEO-example.html.</p>

		<h3 id="encrypt"><strong>L) Encrypt video / subtitle path.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To encrypt the video / subtitle path I have created a tool that will encrypt the video / subtitle path <a href="http://www.gmail.com/vs/" target="_blank">at this link</a>, enter the video / subtitle path (this applies all video / audio / subtitle paths) in the input field then click on the <span class="boldLi">Encrypt media</span> button, once this is done copy the encrypted video path and paste it as the video source parameter from the constructor. There is example provided in the start folder called ENCRYPTED-VIDEO-PATH-example.html and also below there is a sample code illustrating this. The same rule apply to the video poster.</p>

		<p class="boldLi">Method 2:</p>
		<p>Go to Disc – My drive.<br><br>Right click on <span class=class="boldLi">get shareable link</span> the like on screenshot: <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick.jpg" target="blank">get video id 1</a> <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick2.jpg" target="blank">get video id 2</a> and use that video ID to create google drive video URL.<br><br>This is final URL how google drive video URL should look:https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=videoID<br><br>Replace videoID with the id taken from the previous step and use it as the video source:https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B4Au_agYmWFZQWdHdHN3OVJLX0E</p>


		<br>
		<p class="boldLi">Method 2 for larger google drive video files:</p>
		<p>Go to Disc – My drive.<br><br>Right click on <span class=class="boldLi">get shareable link</span> the like on screenshot: <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick.jpg" target="blank">get video id 1</a> <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick2.jpg" target="blank">get video id 2</a><br><br>Copy that URL of the video directly into browser then search for the video src, please see <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick3.jpg" target="blank">get video src</a>.<br><br>Right click on video -> inspect element -> find div with class ‘drive-viewer-video-player’ -> open up iframe -> document -> html -> body -> player -> html5-video-player -> and you will see a &lt;video&gt; tags with the ‘src’ of the video, you need copy/paste that ‘src’ into the player options.<br><br>Use the mp4 or mp3 src as the the video source.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="boldLi">Method 3:</p>
		<p>Go to Disc – My drive.<br><br>Right click on <span class=class="boldLi">get shareable link</span> the like on screenshot: <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick.jpg" target="blank">get video id 1</a> <a href="assets/images/GDRightClick2.jpg" target="blank">get video id 2</a> and use that video ID to create google drive video URL.<br><br>This is how the final URL should look: http://api.getlinkdrive.com/getlink?url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/GOOGLE_DRIVE_VIDEO_ID/view where GOOGLE_DRIVE_VIDEO_ID represents the video id taken for the shareable link<br><br>Once open the link will answer with a JSON, use the JSON value of the url paramaeter as the video source.</p>

		<h3><strong>Dropbox</strong></h3>
		<p>Copy the drop box video link, then replace www.dropbox.com with dl.dropboxusercontent.com.</p>
		<p>Thus the URL: https://www.dropbox.com/s/abcd/file.mp4?dl=0 will become: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/acbd/file.mp4?dl=0 .</p>

		<h3 id="analytics"><strong>P) Setup google analytics</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>I've decided a video tutorial will be better to explain this feature so please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pzWmgumTzo">this video tutorial</a></p>

		<h3 id="redirect"><strong>Q) Redirect / open page when the video has finished to play</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>EVP allows to open a new page or to replace the current page with a new one by setting the <span class="boldLi">redirectURL</span> to point to the page that you want to open. Please see below example. </p>
		<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true, class-name: 'negativeLeftMarginsHTML'">
			//redirect at video end
			redirectURL:"http://www.gmail.com",
			redirectTarget:"_blank",
		</pre>
		<p>If you don't want this feature leave <span class="boldLi">redirectURL</span> blank or remove it entirely</p>

		<h3 id="timestamps"><strong>R) Starting / stopping the video at a specified time using timestamps</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>It is possible to start and / or stop a video at a specified time adding a timestamp as part of the player URL, the format should be <span class="bold">t=hours[h]minutes[m]seconds[s]</span> the hours, minutes and seconds should be higher the 59, some examples as follows to start a video <span class="bold">t=0h2m30s</span> or to stop a video <span class="bold">e=0h2m40s</span>, to start and stop use something like <span class="bold">t=0h2m30s&e=0h2m35s</span></span>.
		<p>This string is part of the URL for example  <span class="bold">http://www.videoplayer-domain.com/#t=0h30m2s&e=0h30m20s</span>.</p>


		<h3 id="vectoricons"><strong>S) Using vector icons icons for the skin</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To use the vector icons instead of the png icons just set in the player constructor useVectorIcons:"yes", that is all that has to be done. There is an example in the start folder called VECTOR-ICONS-example.html, open it in a text editor for refference.</p>

		<br>
        <h3 id="atob"><strong>T) A to B loop</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>The a to b loop feature is basically a plugin for EVP this way it will not add to the total file size if it is not used. To enable it set in the constructor <span class="boldLi">useAToB:"yes"</span> this will make sure that the plugin js file will be loaded, the js file can be found in the content->java->FWDEVPATB.js. To activate this feature for a video add this attribute <span class="boldLi">data-use-a-to-b="yes"</span> when adding a video. Example below.</p>

		<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true, class-name: 'negativeLeftMarginsHTML'">
			<li data-thumb-source="content/thumbnails/small-r3dcov.jpg" data-video-source="[{source:'content/videos2/fwd-480p.mp4', label:''}]" data-poster-source="content/posters/mp4-poster.jpg,content/posters/mp4-poster-mobile.jpg" data-use-a-to-b="yes">
				<div data-video-short-description="">
					<div>
						<p class="classicDarkThumbnailTitle">ROYAL 3D COVERFLOW</p>
						<p class="minimalDarkThumbnailDesc">Fully responsive 3D Coverflow that allows to display media or HTML content with an unique layout.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
		</pre>
		<br>
		<br>
        <h3 id="thumbnails_preview"><strong>U) Thumbnails preview</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>The thumbnails preview is basically a plugin for EVP this way it will not add to the total file size if it is not used. To enable it set in the constructor <span class="boldLi">thumbnailsPreview:"your-file.vtt"</span>where your-file.vtt is the file that contains the data to load and display thumbnails. This will make sure that the plugin js file will be loaded, the js file can be found in the content->java->FWDEVPThumbnailsPreview.js so.If you don't want to use this just leave thumbnailsPreview empty like this <span class="boldLi">thumbnailsPreview:""</span>. Using the .vtt file is self explanatory and it is illustrated below, please note that the .vtt file can contain as many images as you need.</p>

		<p>For atutomatic thumbnails preview set <span class="boldLi">thumbnailsPreview:"auto"</span>, live auto-generated video thumbnails, now is possible to auto-generate video preview thumbnails directly from video. This feature works with self hosted or external hosted mp4/video, HLS/m3u8, Google drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3 and more....  <a href="https://gmail.com/p/evp/thumbnails-preview-live.html" target="_blank">example here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zU0pCtz2k4" target="_blank">video tutorial here</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="chromecast"><strong>V) Chromecast</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>EVP has support for using chromecast, this will enable to play video or audio on a big TV screen and to control the media using the video player interface from the web page.</p>
		<p>You will need a TV that supports chromecast or a chromecast dongle <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASENTER-Wireless-Streaming-Chromecast-Miracast/dp/B07QW67231/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=chromecast&qid=1559293793&s=computers&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1" target="_blank">like this one</a>.</p>
		<p>To enable this feature set in the player constructor showChromecastButton:"yes" if you don't need it just set it to showChromecastButton:"no".</p>
		<p>There are some limitations, this feature will only work on google chrome and has support for mp4 and mp3 media files (HLS, Youtube, Vimeo and advertisement are not supported) also your webpage will have to run on a https protocol.</p>
		<p>If the media content is not mp3 or mp4 and the chromecast is connected, the connection to the TV is stopped and the chroemcast button is removed from the player control bar.</p>

		<p>For all videos, subtitles and posters CORS has to be enabled, you can read about CORS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank">here</a>, to enable CORS is done by adding a .htaccess file in the folder that contains the videos, posters and subtitles, you can find this file in the start/content/subtitles folder. If you are using external files then those files have to be CORS enabled otherwise they will not work. This is a requirement of chromecast so there is no hack around this so this rules has to be followed.</p>
