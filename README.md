ONE VIDEO PLAYER TO RULE THEM ALL! 

Please note that the Video Player installation and configuration is not complicated but because it has a lot of customizable settings it might seem complicated, please go through the entire documentation (in Documentation folder) before trying to install it into your own page. Basically what it must be done is to copy some html code from the examples we provided and paste it into your own html page and of course add your own video file.
